# 100 Days of Code
 Repository with all I've done in my 100 Days of Code Challenge


I'm' triying to organize in the best way possible all my exercises and programms I have made with Python during the lessons.

Every folder has its own readme and 'documentation' so to speak. Feel free to look around the exercises and the code! :)

As this is still a work in progress and my coding skills are also a work in progress all criticism is welcome.


Everytime I complete a new day and its exercises, I will be pushing it to this repository with its own description and documentation (possibly with images later on).

This also serves for me to get pratice with Git and version control.
