# ðŸ’¯ Days of Code with Python!

This repository documents my journey through the 100 Days of Code challenge, where I aim to learn coding by programming one 'challenge' every day. Here, you will find all the exercises and programs I have developed using Python during this challenge.

## Motivation

The purpose of this repository is to organize and showcase my progress throughout the 100 Days of Code challenge. Each folder represents a specific day of the challenge and contains a corresponding README file that provides a summary the exercises completed on that day.

Feel free to explore the exercises and code within each folder. Your feedback and criticism are greatly appreciated, as this challenge serves as an opportunity for me to learn and grow as a programmer.

## Work in Progress

Please note that this repository is still a work in progress. As I progress through the challenge, I will be updating this repository with new exercises, descriptions, and documentation. I may even incorporate images and additional resources in the future.

## Version Control

This repository also serves as an opportunity for me to practice using Git and version control. By utilizing Git, I aim to maintain a clear and organized history of my coding journey throughout this 100 Days of Code challenge.
