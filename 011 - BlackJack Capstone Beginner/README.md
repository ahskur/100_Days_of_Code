One of the capstone projects of the beginners part from 100 Days of Code Python!
Welcome to the Black Jack or 21 game! The goal is to add card numbers but stay lower than 21. If you go over 21, it's a Bust, and you lose immediately. An Ace can be worth 1 or 11.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the following command:

```bash
python Blackjack.py
```

2. The computer is the dealer and will deal two starting cards to both you and the computer.

3. The dealer's first card will be shown to you.

4. Calculate your score based on your hand. Remember, you win immediately if you get a sum of 21 with just two cards.

5. Choose to draw another card ('y') or pass ('n'). The game will continue until you choose to pass or go over 21 (Bust).

6. The computer (dealer) will draw cards until its score is 17 or higher.

7. The game will compare the scores and announce the winner or a draw.

8. To play again, type 'y' when asked, or type 'n' to exit the game.

## Rules

- The deck is unlimited in size.
- There are no jokers.
- The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
- The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
