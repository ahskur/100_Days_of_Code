# Hangman - Python 3

First time using Python to make a console based Hangman game.
I'm also using this project to make myself familiar with GitHub and it's quirks and functions.

#TODO
1) Compile and make a standalone .exe version of Hangman
2) Clean unused things in the code
3) update and clarify some comments
