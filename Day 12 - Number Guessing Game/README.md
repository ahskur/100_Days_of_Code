# NumberGuessingGame
 Project to end of beginner part from 100 Days of Code Python

###########################################################
This project was made using using basic Python concepts to really solidify all the bases and use cases before starting harder projects.

Necessary knowledge for this project was:

- 'import' function
- Use of global and local variables
- 'while' and 'for' loops and logic
- Use of functions with output
- Basic code organization and documentation

# TODO
- Ask if the player wants to go again and reset flag/game
- Make so the game recognizes if the inputted guess is not an integer and ask for a new number input
