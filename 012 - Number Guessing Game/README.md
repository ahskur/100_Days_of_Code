# Number Guessing Game

Project to end of beginner part from 100 Days of Code Python


Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! I'm going to think of a number between 1 and 100, and you have to guess it correctly before meeting the sweet kiss of Death. But don't worry, you have a chance to survive if you can guess it right within the given number of attempts.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the following command:

```bash
python Number_Guessing_Game.py
```

2. Choose a difficulty level by typing 'easy' or 'hard'.
   - Easy mode gives you 10 attempts to guess the number.
   - Hard mode gives you only 5 attempts to guess the number.

3. The game will think of a random number between 1 and 100.

4. You have to input a number as your guess. If your guess is too low or too high, the game will give you a hint.

5. Keep guessing until you find the right number or run out of attempts.

6. If you guess the correct number within the given attempts, you win and avoid the fate of Death. Otherwise, you lose.

7. To play again, type 'y' when asked at the end of the game. Otherwise, type 'n' to exit the game.

**Note**: If you input a number higher than 100 or any invalid input, the game will inform you and prompt for a new guess.

Are you ready to test your luck and survive the Number Guessing Game? Good luck!


## Etc
Necessary knowledge for this project was:

- 'import' function
- Use of global and local variables
- 'while' and 'for' loops and logic
- Use of functions with output
- Basic code organization and documentation

# TODO
- Ask if the player wants to go again and reset flag/game
- Make so the game recognizes if the inputted guess is not an integer and ask for a new number input
