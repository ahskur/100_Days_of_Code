# Pixela Graph Data Management

The Pixela Graph Data Management is a Python script that interacts with the [Pixela API](https://pixe.la) to create a user account, create and manage graphs, post pixels to a graph, update pixel data, and delete pixels. The Pixela API allows you to track and visualize various types of data over time.

## Usage

1. Sign up for an account at [pixe.la](https://pixe.la) and obtain your token and desired username.
2. Replace `"YOUR TOKEN GOES HERE"` with your actual token in the code.
3. Replace `"YOUR USERNAME GOES HERE"` with your actual username in the code.
4. Uncomment the relevant sections of the code to perform the desired actions with the Pixela API.
5. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install requests
```

6. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure to follow the comments in the code and uncomment the desired sections to perform specific actions such as creating an account, creating a graph, posting pixels, updating pixel data, or deleting pixels.

## Dependencies

The Pixela Graph Data Management script relies on the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the Pixela API. Install the required dependency by running the following command:

```bash
pip install requests
```
